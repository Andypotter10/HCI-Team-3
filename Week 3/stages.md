# Stages Definition

## Agreement in Calculation

Juan and Sofia sit down to play the board game with their penguin pieces at the starting position. Juan rolls the dice first, and the result is a green 3 and a green 5. Since both dice are green, they add up to 8. Sofia checks the result and agrees that it is correct. Juan moves his penguin forward 8 spaces on the board. Now it’s Sofia’s turn.

Sofia rolls the dice and gets a red 2 and a green 6. Since the dice are different colors, she subtracts the numbers: 6 - 2 = 4. Juan verifies the result and also confirms it. Sofia moves her penguin forward 4 spaces.

## Disagreement in Calculation

Carlos and Maria are playing the game, and it is Carlos’s turn to roll. He rolls a green 4 and a red 5. He thinks for a moment and says that his result is 9. Maria checks the numbers and disagrees. She believes that the correct result should be 5 - 4 = 1, not 9. Since they cannot agree, they call the teacher over for assistance.

The teacher explains the rule again: if the dice are different colors, they must subtract the smaller number from the larger one. Carlos realizes his mistake and corrects his answer to 1. The teacher praises both students for their efforts, and Carlos moves his penguin forward 1 space.

## Teacher-Assisted Learning Moment

Luis and Elena are playing, and Luis rolls a green 7 and a green 8. He quickly adds them and says the result is 14. Elena checks and agrees with him. Both confidently proceed, and Luis moves his penguin forward 14 spaces.

However, the teacher, who is observing the game, notices the mistake. The correct sum of 7 and 8 is actually 15, not 14. The teacher steps in and gently points out the error, asking Luis and Elena to add the numbers again carefully. After rechecking, they realize their mistake and correct their answer. The teacher praises them for their effort and reminds them of the importance of double-checking their work before moving forward. Luis then moves his penguin forward 15 spaces instead of 14, and the game continues.
