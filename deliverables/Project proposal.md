# Problematic
 Mathematics is difficult at any educational level, but even more so for children who are just beginning their journey in primary school. 
 That is why it is essential to find ways to help them in their learning process, especially in the current era, where they spend a significant amount of time in the digital world, and traditional classes are gradually falling behind in their attempt to provide an adequate education.

# First Proposal
Games are one of the biggest attractions for all ages, especially for children who are constantly seeking entertainment. 
That is why, in this digital era, we consider it important for children to have access to a video game that combines playfulness with education, allowing them to learn effectively without losing interest due to fatigue from traditional teaching methods.

# Uptaded Proposal
After conducting research and analyzing the information obtained from the first meeting, it was concluded that the most feasible approach would be to digitize one of the physical games developed by the teacher. 
These games have already been tested in a real environment with first- and second-grade students, are properly documented, and have sufficient references to be considered effective.

# Game Options
- Formemos cuadrados
- Math Man
- Más-menos pingüinos en el hielo
- Adivina al geometronix
