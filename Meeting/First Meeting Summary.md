*	The professor explained that we are working with what she calls “Didactic Materials.”
*	Didactic materials are physical resources used in the school environment to reinforce the knowledge learned in the field of mathematics.
*	Attempts have been made to translate this concept into digital format in the past, but with little success, as they lose their didactic effectiveness and the human interaction factor.
*	The research provided to us upon entering this project gives us a solid theoretical foundation with verified information, allowing us to build our profiles and have a better understanding of the problem we are dealing with.
*	Several previous projects were presented to us, along with the areas in which they were applied.
*	It was explained why these projects did not achieve the same success as physical resources or how the technological limitations of the time prevented the materials from being effectively transferred to the digital world.
*	There was also discussion about the expectation of applying the professor’s research to develop a functional prototype that can be tested and evaluated.
