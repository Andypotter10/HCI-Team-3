## Game Description
"Más-menos, pingüinos en el hielo" is a digital educational game based on the board game designed by Lourdes Marisol Souza Noha and Genny Rocío Uicab Balloteb. The aim of the game is to reinforce arithmetic skills (addition and subtraction) in primary school children in a playful and interactive way.

## How to Play
The game simulates a dynamic board made up of tiles that represent ice floes. Each player controls a penguin whose movement is determined by rolling two dodecahedral dice, each with 12 faces (6 red and 6 green).

### Arithmetic Operations
- **Addition:** If both dice show the same color, add the numbers obtained.
- **Subtraction:** If the dice show different colors, subtract the smaller number from the larger (avoiding negative results).

### Movement Rules
- If the result of the operation is **greater than or equal to 12**, the player advances two tiles.
- If it is **less than 12**, the player advances one tile.

## Objective
The objective is to traverse the board and reach the last ice floe, encouraging the practice of basic arithmetic operations in an entertaining manner.

## Features
- **Arithmetic Reinforcement:** Practice basic addition and subtraction.
- **Interactive Digital Interface:** A digital adaptation of the original board game.
- **Simple Game Dynamics:** Intuitive rules and movement mechanics based on arithmetic operations.
- **Adaptable:** Possibility to add variants and additional rules to adjust the difficulty and expand the educational challenges.
