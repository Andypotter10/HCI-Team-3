It was mentioned that the game was difficult to understand for new players without a third-party intervention. As a result, some visual improvements were suggested:

Enhance the design and visibility of the dice

Improve the user interface

Add a clear and accessible instructions button

Notes:

It was agreed that it is not necessary to adapt all functional requirements for the prototypeâ€”only the most important ones should be included based on the data we want to evaluate.

Need to focus more on usability over full functionality to ensure the game is intuitive and easy to use during initial testing with students.

Currently it is not necessary for the game to run on mobile.
