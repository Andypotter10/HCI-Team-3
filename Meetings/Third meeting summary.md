Remove FR02 – This requirement is unintuitive for the game’s development, as it forces both players to count every turn, making the game stop feeling like a turn-based game.

Add new FR02 – If a player rolls the dice and moves incorrectly, the opposing player can challenge the move. The student who made the mistake will be penalized, and the other rewarded.

Notes from the physical game:

Average of 6 to 7 voluntary games played

Add option for more players

The game was slow

Math level doesn't matter

Reduce the number of spaces to make it more fluid

Move 1 or 2 spaces based on the rules
