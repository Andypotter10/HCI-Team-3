## Usability Analysis of the Digital Prototype

### Included Usability Elements
- **Distinct penguins on tiles:** Reinforce player identity and position.
- **3D board with blue tiles and columns:** Reproduces the iceberg scenario.
- **Colored virtual dice with numbers:** Preserves the logic and coding of the physical game.
- **Visible instructions:** Clearly explain operational rules.
- **Turn and player status indicators:** Support state tracking and visibility.
- **Accessible controls:** Sequential buttons to roll dice, confirm moves, etc.
- **Explained 3D camera controls:** Improve discoverability and spatial navigation.

### Applied Usability Principles
- **System visibility:** All data and player turns are visible.
- **Match with the real world:** Environment remains faithful to the original game.
- **User control:** Sequential interface with well-defined actions.
- **Clean aesthetics:** Minimalist design focused on the core action.


## Justification for Inclusion or Exclusion of Elements

### Adapted Elements – Why Were They Included?
- **Digital modular board:** Maintains flexibility of the original game and enables multiple paths, supporting thinking and replayability.
- **Penguin pieces:** Essential for player identification, promoting a sense of ownership and continuity.
- **Colored digital dice:** Visually replicate the logic of the physical game, promoting intuitive understanding and symbol-based learning.


### Non-Adapted Elements – Why Were They Excluded?
- **Magnetic Feedback on Physical Pieces:** Physical tactility is not replicable in digital form; replaced by visual-based feedback for equivalent confirmation.
- **Free board assembly:** Although it forms an important part of the game's diversity, it does not form a fundamental part of the game's function.
- **Third party intervention:** Replaced by automatic error detection and correction prompts in the system.
