# Usability Testing

Usability tests designed to evaluate how children interact with the digital prototype.

## Direct User Observation Test

**Objective:** Observe without intervening how the two children interact with the digital prototype to identify issues related to instruction clarity, control usage, turn comprehension, and time taken to navigate the 3D environment.

### Participants
- 2 children, ages 7 and 5.
- Experience with the physical version of the game.

### Procedure
1. **Brief Introduction:** Do not explain how to play.  
2. **Session Start:** Each child sits at the computer and choose their penguin avatar (Red or Blue).  
3. **Initial Observation:** Record how they locate the “Start Game” button without assistance.  
4. **First Turn:** Allow one child at a time to take a first turn (roll dice and move penguin), recording:  
   - Time from turn load until clicking “Roll Dice.”  
   - Any verbal questions or verbalized confusion.  
   - Cursor movements indicating hesitation.  
5. **3D Camera Exploration:** Observe whether the children discover how to rotate or zoom the camera to view the board.  
6. **Second Turn:** Check if the children can complete a second turn without needing help.  
7. **Spontaneous Feedback:** After the second turn, ask each child which parts they found easy or difficult.  
8. **Wrap-up:** Thank them before the next child begins.

### Results

1. **Finding the “Start Game” Button:**  
   - 2 of 2 children located it in under 10 seconds.   

2. **First Turn:**  
   - Average time to click “Roll Dice”: 5 seconds (child A: 4 s, child B: 7 s).  
   - Both children understood they needed to click the dice button.

3. **3D Camera Exploration:**  
   - 2 of 2 discovered left-click dragging to move the board after about 1 minutes.  

4. **Second Turn:**  
   - 1 of 2 children completed the turn without any help.  
   - The other asked for guidance on how to place the penguin after rolling the dice.

5. **Spontaneous Feedback:**  
   - Both children said the penguin movement path were not clearly visible.  
   - Each suggested highlighting board path with better indicators.  
   - One remarked, “I liked the 3D look, but it wasn’t obvious how to move around the board.”

## Specific Task Test

**Objective:** Measure execution times, errors, and need for assistance when completing concrete tasks: rolling dice, moving a penguin, and ending a turn.

### Procedure
1. **Brief Instruction:** Explain how to start the game and the general goal, without detailing each task.  
2. **Task 1: Roll Dice**  
   - Instruction: “Click to roll the dice when it’s your turn.”  
   - Time measured from “Your Turn” prompt until dice result appears.  
   - Note any misclicks.  
3. **Task 2: Move Penguin**  
   - Instruction: “Move your penguin the number of spaces based on the result.”  
   - Time measured from dice result until penguin is correctly placed.  
   - Document any errors (e.g., dragging in wrong direction, placing on the wrong square).  
4. **Task 3: End Turn**  
   - Instruction: “Click the ‘End Turn’ button after moving your penguin.”  
   - Time measured from when the penguin is placed until “End Turn” is clicked.  
   - Note if the child clicked too early or overlooked the button.  
5. **Repeat for Both Participants** and record outcomes in the table below.

### Results Summary

| Participant | Task 1: Roll Dice (s) | Errors T1        | Task 2: Move Penguin (s) | Errors T2                      | Task 3: End Turn (s) | Errors T3       |
|-------------|-----------------------|------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Child A     | 6                     | 0                | 10                       | 1 (placed one space too far)   | 5                    | 0               |
| Child B     | 8                     | 0                | 12                       | 1 (moved in a wrong direction) | 7                    | 0               |

- **Average Times:**  
  - Task 1: 7 seconds  
  - Task 2: 11 seconds  
  - Task 3: 6 seconds  
- **Observed Patterns:**  
  - Most errors in Task 2 were due to confusion about path direction.  

## Physical vs. Digital Comparison Test

**Objective:** Compare playing the physical board game versus the digital prototype to assess engagement level, rule comprehension, and social interaction.

### Procedure (Step by Step)
1. **Introduction:** Explain the game rules briefly.  
2. **Session 1 – Physical Version:** Both children play the board game together with physical board, dice, and penguin pieces.  
3. **Session 2 – Digital Version:** The same two children play the digital prototype on the computer.  
4. **Observation:** For each session, record:  
   - Effective play time (time spent actively playing).  
   - Social interaction (questions, laughter, disagreements).  
   - Rule clarification requests.  
5. **Group Discussion:** Ask both children what they liked and didn’t like about each version.  
6. **Quantitative Data Collection:** Note number of illegal moves, rule disputes, and pauses for clarification.

### Results

1. **Engagement & Social Interaction:**  
   - **Physical Session:**  
     - Laughter and conversation occurred every few turns.  
     - Only one rule clarification was needed.  
   - **Digital Session:**  
     - Fewer comments between turns; mostly focused on the screen.  
     - Three requests for technical help (Mostly about path direction).  

2. **Rule Comprehension:**  
   - **Physical:**  
     - No illegal moves.  
   - **Digital:**  
     - Constant illegal moves; wrong path direction.  

3. **Effective Play Time:**  
   - **Physical:** 18 minutes of active play out of 20.  
   - **Digital:** 13 minutes of active play out of 20, due to path issues.  

4. **Qualitative Feedback:**  
   - **Digital Version:** “The game looks nice, but sometimes I wasn’t sure where to move.”


## Satisfaction Questionnaire

**Objective:** Gather quantitative feedback on overall experience: ease of use, learning curve, and satisfaction.

### Questionnaire Design
A 5-point Likert scale (1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree) with these statements:  
1. “It was easy to understand how to play the first time.”  
2. “The controls to move the penguin are intuitive.”  
3. “I could view player information without difficulty.”  
4. “I liked the visual design of the game.”  
5. “I would recommend this game to my friends.”

### Results

| Statement                                                         | Child A Rating | Child B Rating | Average Rating |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| 1. It was easy to understand how to play the first time.          | 3              | 3              | 3.5            |
| 2. The controls to move the penguin are intuitive.                | 2              | 1              | 1.5            |
| 3. I could view player information without difficulty.            | 3              | 2              | 2.5            |
| 4. I liked the visual design of the game.                         | 5              | 4              | 4.5            |
| 5. I would recommend this game to my friends.                     | 4              | 3              | 3.5            |

### Interpretation
- Visual design scored highest (4.5 average), indicating that graphics appeal to the children.  
- Information clarity averaged 2.5–3.5, revealing opportunities to improve usability. 
- The controls to move the penguin averaged 1.5, making it a terrible movement that MUST be improved.
- Recommendation score (3.5) suggests moderate enthusiasm, with room for improvement in overall ease of play.
