4. **Definition of the Physical Version of the First Digital Prototype**
   - Analyzed materials and construction methods.
   - Outlined the approach for field testing.

5. **Initial Interfaces of the Digital Prototype**
   - Created sketches and flow diagrams for user interaction.
   - Developed mockups for the main screens.

6. **Visit to a Primary School with the Physical Prototype**
   - Conducted a first field test with potential users.
   - Collected observations and feedback for future improvements.

## Development Details

- **Development of the First Digital Prototype**  
  - Implementation of the base structure and main logic.
  - Setup of initial interface elements.

- **Development of the Physical Version of the First Digital Prototype**

### Functional Features (F)

- **F1 - Dice Rolling Mechanics**  
  - Programming and testing of the dice roll logic.
  - Adjustment of probabilities and result validation.

- **F2 - Result Validation**  
  - Verification of win/loss conditions or turn advancement.
  - Generation of user feedback messages.

- **F3 - Turn-based Gameplay**  
  - Definition of the turn sequence and management of the game flow.
  - Handling events at the start and end of each turn.

- **F4 - Time Tracking**  
  - Recording the time elapsed in each game session.
  - Displaying the accumulated time for later analysis.

- **F5 - Pre-Thread Intervention**  
  - Implementation of the logic before the main intervention.
  - Configuration of practice or tutorial scenarios.
