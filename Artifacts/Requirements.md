## Non-Functional Requirements

| Non-functional Requirement           | Description                                                                                              | Justification                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| NFR_1 Performance and response time  | The application must respond within 100 milliseconds to each user action.                                | A quick response is essential to maintain game fluidity and avoid frustration, especially in children who require immediate feedback to learn from their actions. 0.1 seconds is the limit for users to feel an instantaneous reaction. |
| NFR_2 Usability and simplicity       | The interface must be clear, intuitive, and have simple navigation.                                      | A simple design reduces the learning curve and allows children, with little technical experience, to interact without complications, making the experience more pleasant and educational.                                     |
| NFR_3 Accessibility                  | Incorporate options such as high contrast, narration of instructions, and adjustments in font size with sizes between 24 to 32 pixels. | Ensures that the game is usable for all users, including those with visual or hearing disabilities, expanding inclusion and participation in the educational environment.                                                    |
| NFR_4 Cross-platform compatibility   | The game must be functional on tablets and mobile devices.                                               | Facilitates access to the game from various devices, allowing its use in different environments and expanding its reach among children and educational audiences.                                                           |
| NFR_5 Reliability and stability      | The system must function without crashes or critical errors during use.                                   | Consistency in operation reinforces user confidence and avoids interruptions that can distract or demotivate children, ensuring a continuous and trouble-free educational experience.                                        |
| NFR_6 Security and privacy           | User data must be protected and comply with child privacy regulations.                                   | It is essential to avoid exposure of sensitive information and guarantee a safe environment, especially when dealing with vulnerable audiences such as children.                                                             |
| NFR_7 Maintainability                | The code must be well documented and structured in a modular way.                                        | Facilitates future updates, error corrections, and incorporation of new functionalities without affecting the user experience, guaranteeing the evolution and continuous improvement of the digitized game.                  |
| NFR_8 Portability                    | The application must be able to adapt to different environments or platforms without losing functionality.| Allows the game to run homogeneously on different devices and contexts of use, ensuring a consistent experience regardless of the hardware or operating system used.                                                        |
| NFR_9 Resource consumption optimization | The system must efficiently use memory, CPU, and battery.                                             | It is important for the game to run smoothly even on low-end devices or with limited resources, avoiding performance drops that could interrupt the user experience.                                                        |
| NFR_10 Text design for child attention | Text must be clear, visible, and direct, with a design that maintains children's attention.            | Clear text formatting helps children focus on the content without getting distracted by complex or poorly designed text elements.                                                                                           |
| NFR_11 Direct and concise text content | Texts must be straight to the point, without detours, metaphors, or long instructions. The content should clearly indicate what the child needs to do or understand. Young children respond better to concrete and direct instructions. According to Nielsen Norman Group, children need explicit instructions and well-defined actions to avoid getting lost. Additionally, direct design reduces cognitive load, which is fundamental for their age. | Direct communication is essential when designing for children as it minimizes confusion and supports their developing cognitive abilities. |
