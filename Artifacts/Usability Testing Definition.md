# Usability Testing Definition
## Direct User Observation Testing
Direct observation will be used to observe how children interact with the game without intervention. This will assess the clarity of instructions, use of controls, understanding of turns and steps, and the time it takes to navigate the 3D board environment.

## Specific Task Testing
Children are given specific objectives to complete (rolling dice, moving penguins, ending turns), and their execution time, errors, and need for external assistance will be measured.

## Discoverability Testing
This test assesses whether users can discover features such as using the 3D camera or reading player status without assistance. The goal is for children to understand the functionalities with minimal instruction and be able to use their intuition to use camera controls and status displays. Their actual usability should be tested.

## Physical-digital comparison test
As part of gathering user data, the physical game should be compared to the digital one. The goal is to evaluate the level of engagement, rule understanding, and social interaction between the prototypes. If any shortcomings are identified in the virtual prototype, verify with data how much it undermines the game's purpose.

## Satisfaction questionnaire
A questionnaire provides a quantitative perception of the user experience. Ease of use, ease of learning instructions, and satisfaction should be determined.
