# Usability Analysis: *More-Less Penguins on Ice*

## 1. Usability Elements of the Physical Game

### Usability Elements of the Original Physical Game
- **Modular board (puzzle style):** Encourages flexibility, exploration, and teamwork.
- **Penguin-shaped pieces with magnets:** Provides tactile feedback and visual differentiation.
- **Colored dodecahedral dice:** Represents operations through color coding.
- **Simple and clear rules:** Low learning curve and effective decision-making.
- **Social feedback:** Promotes collaborative learning through peer evaluation.
- **Rule variations:** Encourages replayability and progressive adaptation.
- **Thematic narrative (ice and penguins):** Maintains attention and reinforces emotional engagement.

### Elements Adapted to the Digital Prototype
- Modular board with random generation.
- Digital avatars (distinct penguins).
- Animated virtual dice with color coding.
- Integrated rules.

### Elements Not Adapted
- Magnetic fixation of pieces: replaced by visual snapping.
- Free board assembly by children: replaced with pre-defined layout.
- Finger counting: replaced by visual and auditory support.

## 2. Usability Analysis of the Digital Prototype

### Included Usability Elements
- **Distinct penguins on tiles:** Reinforce player identity and position.
- **3D board with blue tiles and columns:** Reproduces the iceberg scenario.
- **Colored virtual dice with numbers:** Preserves the logic and coding of the physical game.
- **Visible instructions:** Clearly explain operational rules.
- **Turn and player status indicators:** Support state tracking and visibility.
- **Accessible controls:** Sequential buttons to roll dice, confirm moves, etc.
- **Explained 3D camera controls:** Improve discoverability and spatial navigation.

### Applied Usability Principles
- **System visibility:** All data and player turns are visible.
- **Match with the real world:** Environment remains faithful to the original game.
- **User control:** Sequential interface with well-defined actions.
- **Clean aesthetics:** Minimalist design focused on the core action.

## 3. Justification for Inclusion or Exclusion of Elements

### Adapted Elements – Why Were They Included?
- **Digital modular board:** Maintains flexibility of the original game and enables multiple paths, supporting spatial thinking and replayability.
- **Penguin pieces (avatars):** Essential for player identification, promoting a sense of ownership and continuity.
- **Colored digital dice:** Visually replicate the logic of the physical game, promoting intuitive understanding and symbol-based learning.

### Non-Adapted Elements – Why Were They Excluded?
- **Magnet on pieces:** Physical feedback is unnecessary in the digital environment; replaced by visual feedback including drag-and-drop movement.
- **Free board assembly:** Although a creative moment in the physical game, it can be too complex for young children to manage digitally without assistance.
- **Finger counting:** A concrete motor practice that cannot be effectively replicated on screen.
