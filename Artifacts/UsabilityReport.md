# Usability Analysis: *More-Less Penguins on Ice*

## 1. Usability Elements of the Physical Game

### Usability Elements of the Original Physical Game
- **Modular board (puzzle style):** Encourages flexibility, exploration, and teamwork.
- **Penguin-shaped pieces with magnets:** Provides tactile feedback and visual differentiation.
- **Colored dodecahedral dice:** Represents operations through color coding.
- **Simple and clear rules:** Low learning curve and effective decision-making.
- **Social feedback:** Promotes collaborative learning through peer evaluation.
- **Rule variations:** Encourages replayability and progressive adaptation.
- **Thematic narrative (ice and penguins):** Maintains attention and reinforces emotional engagement.

### Elements Adapted to the Digital Prototype
- Modular board with random generation.
- Digital avatars (distinct penguins).
- Animated virtual dice with color coding.
- Integrated rules.

### Elements Not Adapted
- Magnetic fixation of pieces: replaced by visual snapping.
- Free board assembly by children: replaced with pre-defined layout.
- Finger counting: replaced by visual and auditory support.
